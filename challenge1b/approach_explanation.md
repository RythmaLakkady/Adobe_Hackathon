# Approach Explanation: Rule-Based Document Analysis and Section Extraction

## Overview

This solution employs a lightweight, rule-based approach to analyze PDF documents and extract the most relevant sections based on a given persona and job-to-be-done. The methodology prioritizes efficiency, interpretability, and offline operation while maintaining high accuracy in section relevance scoring.

## Core Methodology

### 1. PDF Text Extraction and Layout Analysis

The system uses `pdfminer.six` to extract text while preserving layout information including font sizes, styles (bold/italic), and positional data. This allows for intelligent detection of document structure without relying on predefined formatting assumptions.

### 2. Section Detection Strategy

The approach combines two complementary methods:

**Fuzzy Pattern Matching**: The system maintains a set of expected section patterns (e.g., "Comprehensive Guide to Major Cities", "Culinary Experiences") and uses Levenshtein distance to match actual document text against these patterns, even when there are minor variations in wording.

**Font-Based Heading Detection**: When pattern matching yields insufficient results, the system analyzes font characteristics to identify headings. It calculates statistical thresholds for font sizes and combines this with style information (bold, italic) and structural cues (numbering patterns) to classify text as headings at different levels.

### 3. Rule-Based Relevance Scoring

Instead of using machine learning models, the system employs a multi-factor scoring algorithm:

- **Keyword Overlap**: Sections are scored based on the presence of predefined target keywords relevant to the domain
- **Persona Alignment**: Text is analyzed for overlap with keywords extracted from the user's persona and job description
- **Content Quality**: Longer sections with substantial content receive higher scores, as they likely contain more comprehensive information
- **Title Descriptiveness**: Sections with longer, more descriptive titles are prioritized
- **Document Position**: Earlier sections often contain more foundational information and receive slight scoring boosts

### 4. Content Refinement and Analysis

For each selected section, the system performs sub-section analysis by:

- Splitting content into logical paragraphs
- Using similarity scoring to identify the most representative paragraph for each section
- Ensuring the refined content maintains the essential information while being concise

## Technical Advantages

**Lightweight Architecture**: By avoiding machine learning dependencies like transformers and large language models, the solution maintains a Docker image size under 200MB, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments and fast deployment.

**Offline Operation**: All processing occurs locally without requiring internet connectivity or model downloads, ensuring reliability and privacy.

**Interpretable Results**: The rule-based scoring system provides transparent reasoning for section selection, allowing users to understand why specific content was prioritized.

**Fast Processing**: Without the computational overhead of neural networks, the system processes documents rapidly while maintaining accuracy through carefully tuned heuristics.

## Scalability and Adaptability

The approach can be easily customized by modifying keyword sets, adjusting scoring weights, or adding new pattern recognition rules without retraining models. This makes it particularly suitable for domain-specific applications where interpretability and quick adaptation are essential.
